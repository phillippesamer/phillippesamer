### Hi there 👋

back-end developer and consultant;

computer science and mathematics degrees (_read: solution architect and problem solver_);

code and language nerd (passion for well crafted code and beautiful writing);


- ⚙️ I use daily: `.cpp`, `.py`, `.sh`
- 📈 Expertise in optimization and the design and analysis of algorithms
- 💅 I made it through the PhD! [Pressemelding frå UiB i anledning ph.d.-grad disputas](https://www.uib.no/nye-doktorgrader/166501/matematikk-og-kode-beste-uavhengige-delnettverk)
- 🔎 Long, [detailed version of my CV](phillippe-samer-detailed-cv.pdf) with almost all projects I worked on over the past decade or so

Have a nice day! 🍀
