#### Hi there 👋

code and language nerd (_passion for well crafted code and beautiful writing_);

computer science and mathematics degrees (_read: systematic problem solver_);

glad new employee (_consultant and system developer_) at [Bouvet ASA](https://www.bouvet.no/).

- ⚙️ I dig `.cpp` and `.java`
- :rocket: interested in robust and scalable solution architectures
- 📈 expertise in optimization and the design and analysis of algorithms
- 💅 I made it through the PhD! [Pressemelding frå UiB i anledning ph.d.-grad disputas](https://www.uib.no/nye-doktorgrader/166501/matematikk-og-kode-beste-uavhengige-delnettverk)
- 🔎 long, [detailed version of my CV](phillippe-samer-detailed-cv.pdf) with most of the projects I worked on over the past decade or so (dog-walker not included 🐶)

have a nice day! 🍀
